Integration and Development Approach:

Use Docker to containerize each module, ensuring consistency across development environments.
Implement a microservices architecture using Kubernetes for orchestration, allowing modules to be developed and scaled independently.
Use Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative development.
Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) using Jenkins or GitLab CI.
Use pytest for unit testing and integration testing of modules.
Implement logging using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized log management and analysis.
Use Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.

Development Steps:

Set up the development environment with all necessary tools and libraries.
Create Docker containers for each module.
Implement basic functionality for each module using the specified technologies.
Develop the Core Processing Unit to manage communication between modules using Kafka and Ray.
Create interfaces for each module to send and receive data through the Core Processing Unit.
Implement basic versions of each module's functionality.
Develop integration tests to ensure modules can communicate effectively.
Create a simple demo application that utilizes multiple modules to showcase the system's capabilities.
Continuously refine and expand module functionality based on testing results.
